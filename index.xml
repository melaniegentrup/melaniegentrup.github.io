      <description>After three seasons at Nebraska, Scott Frost’s record is 12-20, which is not ideal. Nebraska definitely isn’t a playoff team, nor has it competed for a Big Ten title in a long time. Since Nebraska joined the Big Ten, it appeared in one conference title back in 2012 and got throttled by Wisconsin. Since joining, the Huskers have gone 68-55. So, what’s up with Nebraska? What’s been the issue for all these years in the Big Ten?</description>
